# EarthByte Model

This model is imported from the *EarthByte* model,
that is the default model included in [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/).
The original model can be downloaded
from the [EarthByte page](https://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-3-software-and-data-sets/).

## File descriptions

All the files are prefixed as `earthbyte-*`
usually followed by the pixelation resolution,
the size of time step,
and the kind of file.

### Pixelation

The model is available in three resolutions:
e360 (360 pixels in the equatorial ring),
e180,
and e120.
It is based on the continental polygons,
extended with the volcanic provinces from Johansson et al. (2018).
It is stored in the file `pixels-earthbyte-xxx.tab`
in which `xxx` is used to indicate the resolution.
